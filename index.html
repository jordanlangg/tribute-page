      <p>Jung Ho-seok (정호석) was born on February 18, 1994, in Gwangju (광주시), South Korea. Growing up he lived with his parents and older sister. Before debuting as J-Hope as a member of the Idol group BTS, he was part of the underground dance team Neuron and took dance classes at Gwangju Music Academy. J-Hope had been relatively well known for his skills in dance prior to his debut; he won various local prizes for dance, including placing first in a national dance competition in 2008. His skills in dance led him to gain interest in singing, that helped him to audition as an idol trainee. As a trainee, J-Hope was featured as a rapper in Jo Kwon's song "Animal", which was released in 2012.
       <br>
        On June 13, 2013, J-Hope made his debut as a member of BTS on Mnet's M! Countdown with the track "No More Dream" from their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool. He was the third member to join the group as a trainee after RM and Suga. J-Hope has since been involved in the creation process of every album in BTS' discography.
  	     <br>
  	      His stage name, "J-Hope (제이홉)", is a reference to the myth of Pandora's box, as after the box was opened and all the evils inside were released to the world, the only thing left was hope.

    	J-Hope has been described as having an upbeat and energetic tone to his music and performances. His mixtape, Hope World, was described as having a fun nature and variety of musical genres, including synth-pop, trap, house, alternative hip hop, funk-soul, and retro elements. The lyrical elements of the mixtape, notably the lead song "Daydream", was praised by Billboard magazine for its discussion of the difficulties an idol faces in their career, various literary references, and fun presentation of the serious subject matter.

	    J-Hope cites the adventurous nature of Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and the works of Kyle, Aminé, and Joey Badass as influencers on his style and work on Hope World. The idea of peace has also provided a basis for much of his lyrics, stating that <b>"it'd be fantastic to become a part of someone's personal peace through my music"</b> in an interview with Time magazine. The idea of "representing the modern generation" has also influenced his work on BTS' music.
          <br>
	        He released his first mixtape, <a href="https://bts.fandom.com/wiki/Hope_World_(mixtape)" id="tribute-link" target="_blank"><em><b>Hope World</b></em></a>, on March 1, 2018 - a mixtape that "showcases exceptional creativity, genuine personality, and a cohesive sense of direction."
